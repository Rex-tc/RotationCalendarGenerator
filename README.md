## Historical Changelog

### 1.1
* Added a changelog (lol)
* Changelog is accessible through button in about menu
* Main menu will now be disposed when "Start" is clicked
* Made it actually look ok on Windows. aka text not clipping out of window
* Removed redundant code in menu. Theoretically this should make it faster but in practice it won't change much
### 2.0
* Fixed file selection window, should now work properly on Windows and better than before on Mac
* "Polished" the changelog menu
* Known Error: WILL crash in Mac when clicking "Back" while in changelog menu and in fullscreen. Don't know about Windows.

### 2.0.2

### 2.0.3
* removed Main.getVersion()
### 2.1
